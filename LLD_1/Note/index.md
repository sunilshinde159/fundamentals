# What is Low Level Design or LLD – Learn System Design


#### LLD describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs. It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document. It provides us with the structure and behavior of class as different entities have different character sets. From this design, it is easy for a developer to write down logic and henceforth the actual code for it.
